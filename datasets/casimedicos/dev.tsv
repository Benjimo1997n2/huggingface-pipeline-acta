__label__noRel	IVU	It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain
__label__noRel	IVU	However, it has a lower yield than the others
__label__noRel	IVU	Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously
__label__noRel	IVU	IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options
__label__noRel	IVU	It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions
__label__noRel	IVU	It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis.
__label__noRel	IVU	It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals
__label__noRel	IVU	It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney
__label__noRel	IVU	Contrast-enhanced CT seems to me to be the most efficient option
__label__noRel	IVU	It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures
__label__noRel	IVU	Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation
__label__noRel	IVU	It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide
__label__noRel	IVU	It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm
__label__noRel	IVU	With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function
__label__noRel	IVU	Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent
__label__noRel	IVU	It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis.
__label__noRel	IVU	Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops
__label__noRel	IVU	Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity
__label__noRel	IVU	Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis
__label__noRel	IVU	My answer would be CT with ev contrast and excretory phase (answer (c)), in terms of performance, sensitivity and specificity
__label__noRel	IVU	There are radiology services more skilled or predisposed to one or the other

__label__noRel	CT with contrast	Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women)
